### Features of project:
- Track & controll hardware via: Application - Telegram Bot - Message Text (SMS)
- Log files into SD-Card
- Show received message and its command on a 2*16 LCD
- DeepSleep on Arduino for lower power consumption


## 1) Application
This application is made with ‚ù§ by using "Flutter" framework, using "Bloc" architecture!
The application consists different pages to track sensors, irrigate manually and also set a threshold for automatic irrigation.

### How to use application
For help getting started with Flutter, checkout
[Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

# 2) Embedded Hardware Core
This project uses an "Arduino UNO" and "Wemos D1 mini" as hardware cores.
### Following components are used in the project:
- Arduino Uno
- Wemos D1 mini
- GSM SIM808
- DHT11 Module (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
- YL69 Module (Soil Moisture Sensor)
- Relay 5v, 1 channel
- SD-Card shield
- LCD char 2*16
- Voltage Convertor
- 9v Battery, Regulator, Resistors and more ...

Upcoming folders contain certain files & headers used for each microcontroller.
You can see schematics in following picture:

#### Note: "Wemos D1 mini" connects to a router to access internet. Do not forget to set SSID & Password of your modem in following file: "Embedded Hardware Core/wemos/wifi.h"


# 3) Server
This project uses two servers to operate correctly.
- Local server is set to store sensor data as well as communicating with application.
- Telegram bot Server contains API for track & control hardware via "Telegram Application"

## 3-1) Django Local Server:
This folder contains files for database and backend, using Python & Django framework.

### How to use local server
- Open terminal in mentioned folder
- type ".\venv\Scripts\activate" in CMD
- type "py manage.py runserver 192.168.1.102:8000" in CMD

#### Note: "192.168.1.102" is my laptop IP after connecting to router. You can access your own IP by running "ipconfig" in CMD. Keep it in mind that all modules and also application are running on this local IP.

## 3-2) Python Telegram Bot Server
This folder contains API for Telegram Bot, using Python.
